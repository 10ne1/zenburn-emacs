# About #

Zenburn for Emacs is a direct port of the popular
[Zenburn](http://slinky.imukuppi.org/zenburnpage/ Zenburn) theme for vim,
developed by Jani Nurminen. It's my personal belief (and
that of its many users I presume) that it's one of the best low
contrast color themes out there and that it's is exceptionally easy on
the eyes.

# Installation #

Zenburn depends on the color-theme package, so you should have it
installed. After that just put this in your .emacs(or equivalent):

`(require 'color-theme-zenburn)`

`(color-theme-zenburn)`

Zenburn for Emacs is also available for installation via the
[Marmalade](http://marmalade-repo.org/) package repository.
